OSI model
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that "provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection."[2] In the OSI reference model, the communications between systems are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

Types of Area Networks
Common types of area networks are:

LAN: Local Area Network
WAN: Wide Area Network
WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network
MAN: Metropolitan Area Network
SAN: Storage Area Network, System Area Network, Server Area Network, or sometimes Small Area Network
CAN: Campus Area Network, Controller Area Network, or sometimes Cluster Area Network
PAN: Personal Area Network

TCP/IP is a suite of protocols used by devices to communicate over the Internet and most local networks. It is named after two of it's original protocols---the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP provides apps a way to deliver (and receive) an ordered and error-checked stream of information packets over the network. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used by apps to deliver a faster stream of information by doing away with error-checking
