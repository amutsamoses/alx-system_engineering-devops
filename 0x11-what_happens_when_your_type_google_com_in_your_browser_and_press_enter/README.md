Demystifying How Websites Work: A Beginner's Guide

Have you ever thought about what happens when you type a website address like https://www.google.com in your browser and hit the Enter key? It's like sending a letter to your favorite celebrity, you need to know their address, right? Similarly, when you type a website address, your browser needs to know the IP address of the website server where the website is hosted.

Once your browser has the website server's address, it connects to it using a special set of rules called TCP/IP, just like a phone call with a friend has rules to follow. However, before it can connect to the website server, it needs to pass through a firewall that acts like a gatekeeper to make sure that no unwanted visitors enter.

After passing the firewall, your browser and the website server begin to speak to each other using HTTPS and SSL. It's like having a secret code to make sure that no one can listen to your conversation, just like how you would whisper in your friend's ear to keep your secret conversation private.

Now, the request is sent to the website server, but how does the server know which of its computers should respond? This is where the load-balancer comes in. It's like a traffic cop who decides which server computer should handle the request.

Once the correct server computer has been chosen, it sends back the website's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which is like getting a package from your online shopping order. But, if the website needs more information, like a password or your name, it asks the application server, which is like asking a customer service representative for help with your order.

Finally, if the website needs to display some data, like the latest news headlines, it retrieves that data from the database, which is like searching for a specific book in a library. Once it has the data, it sends it back to the website server, which puts everything together and sends it back to your browser.

In summary, visiting a website is like sending a letter, making a phone call, having a secret conversation, meeting a traffic cop, getting a package, asking a customer service representative for help, and searching for a book in a library. Understanding how all these steps work together can help you navigate the internet better and make sure that you get the information you need.

In the event that the DNS request fails to resolve the website's IP address, a resolver comes in to provide the necessary IP address. This is like asking a friend for directions when you're lost.
